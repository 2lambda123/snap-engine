Missing Features
================

1) Missing scrollbars (OK)
2) Missing viewport change notification (OK)
3) Missing available model area in viewport (OK)
4) Missing Layer style properties, e.g. shape color, etc... (partly done)

Problems with existing BEAM components
======================================

1) PixelPositionListener: change events can only be fired by imageLayerModel layers
2) ImageUpdateListener: change events can only be fired by imageLayerModel layers
3) Currently no idea how to apply color manipulations to the JAI DAG
