Missing Features
================

1) Missing scrollbars
2) Missing viewport change notification
3) Missing available model area in viewport (for scrollbars)
4) Missing Layer style properties, e.g. shape color, etc...

Problems with existing BEAM components
======================================

1) PixelPositionListener: change events can only be fired by image layers
2) ImageUpdateListener: change events can only be fired by image layers
3) Currently no idea how to apply color manipulations to the JAI DAG

Plan
====

1) Merge BasicImageView into ProductSceneView
1) Replace usages of ViewModel by Viewport (use Adapter)
2) Replace usages of LayerModel by CollectionLayer (use Adapter)
