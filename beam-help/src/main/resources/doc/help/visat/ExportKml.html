<h3>Export Displayed Image as KML</h3>

<p>This command allows the export of the loaded image to a KML file.
    Only images from loaded bands, that are in lat/lon projection can be exported.</p>

<p>
    The save dialog offers the possibility to choose whether pixel containing No-Data values should be
    drawn transparent or not.</p>

<p>Following feratures of the product are exported:
    <ul>
        <li>raster data</li>
        <li>color legend</li>
        <li>pins</li>
    </ul><p></p>

<p>To get an apealing RGB export from products which compute the red, green and blue bands
    using a formula a trick is necessary. In a first step a RGB image must be created and
    the calculated virtual band have to be stored in the product (tick the checkbox at the bottom of the RGB dialog).
    Then at least for the virtual_red band (better for all three virtual colour bands)
    either a no-data value or a valid pixel expression has to be set to mask out
    the border which results from the projection.
    For land or ocean products the appropriate flags must be taken into account, too.
    As a final step a new RGB image has to be created using these three virtual bands.

    The exported image is saved in the KML the Keyhole Markup Language (link: <a href="http://earth.google.com/kml/">http://earth.google.com/kml/</a>).
    To view this file a version of Google Earth (link: <a href="http://earth.google.com/">http://earth.google.com/</a>)
    is necessary.
