<p>The most important features and enhancements introduced in BEAM 4.7 are summarized here:</p>
<ul>
    <li>VISAT now provides a <a href="../visat/GeometryManagement.html">Geometry Management</a> allowing users
        to <b>draw and manipulate geometries</b> (vector data) or to import them from <b>ESRI Shapefiles</b>.
        Geometries are now an integral part of the BEAM data model.
    </li>
    <li>The VISAT <a href="../visat/MaskROIManagement.html">Mask and ROI Management</a> has been revised completely.
        Any number of raster data masks can be defined by <b>band maths expressions</b>, <b>value ranges</b> and
        <b>existing geometries</b>. Each mask can serve as a <b>region of interest (ROI)</b> for raster data analysis.
    </li>
    <li>The <a href="../visat/StatisticsDialog.html">Statistics</a>, <a href="../visat/HistogramDialog.html">Histogram</a>,
        and <a href="../visat/ScatterplotDialog.html">Scatter Plot</a> tool windows have been enhanced in order to <b>support the
            new, named ROIs</b>.
        The <a href="../visat/StatisticsDialog.html">Statistics</a> tool window can now operate on <b>multiple ROIs</b>.
    </li>
    <li>The
        <a href="../visat/Reprojection.html">Reprojection</a> (formerly 'Map Projection'),
        <a href="../visat/Mosaic.html">Mosaicing</a> and
        <a href="../visat/Orthorectification.html">Orthorectification</a> processors have been redesigned from scratch.
        Due to the great <a href="http://www.geotools.org/">GeoTools</a> library, BEAM now offers more than
        <b>100 predefined, map projections</b> based on their <a href="http://www.epsg.org/">EPSG</a>
        codes. For user-defined map projections you can now select from 25 map projection
        transformations and more than 100 geodetic datums. Since the new Reprojection, Mosaicing and
        Orthorectification processors are developed using the  <b>BEAM Graph Processing Framework</b> (GPF), they now
        offer a <b>powerful command-line</b> and can be used in any GPF XML <b>processing graph</b> for, e.g., pre-
        and post-processing.
        Finally, the <b>runtime performance</b> of this tools has been drastically improved.
    </li>
    <li>The <a href="../visat/NavigationWindow.html">Navigation</a> tool window has been improved. It is now feasible
        to display a <b>synchronized pixel cursor</b> in all image views.
    </li>
    <li>The <a href="../visat/WorldMap.html">World Map</a> tool window has been completely revised. It now uses a
        <b>higher-resolution RGB</b> (NASA Blue Marble) in which you can easily pan and zoom in and out.
    </li>
</ul>
