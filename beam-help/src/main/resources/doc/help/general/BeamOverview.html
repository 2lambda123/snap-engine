<h3>BEAM Version 4.1</h3>


<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>BEAM, the Basic ENVISAT Toolbox for (A)ATSR and MERIS, is a collection of executable tools and Application
    Programming Interfaces (APIs) which have been developed to facilitate the utilization, viewing and
    processing of ENVISAT MERIS, AATSR and ASAR data. The purpose of the BEAM is not to duplicate existing
    commercial packages, but to complement them with functions dedicated to the handling of ENVISAT MERIS and
    AATSR products.</p>

<p>The main components of the BEAM are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>VISAT - A visualization, analyzing and processing software</li>
    <li>A set of scientific data processors running either from the command line or invoked by VISAT</li>
    <li>A data product converter tool allowing a user to convert raw data products to RGB images, <a
            href="../visat/ExportHDF.html">HDF-5</a> or
        the <a href="BeamDimapFormat.html">BEAM-DIMAP</a> standard format
    </li>
    <li>A Java&#153; API which provides ready-to-use components for remote sensing related application
        development and plug-in points for new BEAM extensions
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Standard Product Format</h4>

<p>VISAT and the scientific data processors use a simple data input/output format,
    which makes it easy to import ENVISAT data in other imaging applications. The
    format is called <a href="http://www.spotimage.fr/dimap/spec/dimap.htm">DIMAP<sup>&reg;</sup></a>
    and has been developed by SPOT-Image, France. The BEAM software uses a special
    DIMAP profile called <a href="BeamDimapFormat.html">BEAM-DIMAP</a>, which has
    the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A single product header (XML) containing the product meta-data</li>
    <li>An associated data directory containing ENVI<sup>&reg;</sup>-compatible images for each band.</li>
    <li>Each image in the directory is composed of a header file (ASCII text) and an image data file (flat binary)</li>
</ul>


<h4>Source Code</h4>

<p>The complete BEAM software has been developed under the GNU public license
    and comes with full source code (Java<sup>TM</sup>).</p>

<h4>Supported Platforms</h4>

<p>BEAM 4 is programmed in pure Java&#153; to allow a maximum portability. The
    BEAM software has been successfully tested under MS Windows&#153;&nbsp;XP<sup>&reg;</sup>
    as well as under Linux and Solaris<sup>&reg;</sup>; operating systems.
    BEAM will be available for Mac OS X as soon as Apple supports the
    J2SE 6 platform.</p>
