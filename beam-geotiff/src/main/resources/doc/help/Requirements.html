<h1>Requirements Scratch Book</h1>

<p>Following GeoTiff files found on remotesensing.org:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>One image / One band</b></li>
    In this format are the most images. Very normal.<br>
    Location: remotesensing.org\gdal_eg, remotesensing.org\intergraph, remotesensing.org\made_up,
    remotesensing.org\other
    <li><b>One image / One band</b><br></li>
    Version 1.0, KeyRevision = 1.0 : UTM2GTIF.TIF <br>
    Version 1.0, KeyRevision = 0.2 : SP27GTIF.TIF <br>
    Location: remotesensing.org\spot\chicago
    <li><b>One image / One band</b><br></li>
    With a ColorMap <br/>
    Location: remotesensing.org\usgs\o*.tif
    <li><b>Multi(8) image / Multi(3) band</b><br></li>
    Each image represents the same scene, in different resolutions. <br>
    SubImageKey is used (Zero, ReducedImage); With JPEG compression.<br>
    Each image is tiled. (Image pyramid)<br>
    Only first image has GeoTiff information. <br>
    Location: remotesensing.org\misc\tjpeg.tif
</ul>

<h1>Problems</h1>

<ul>
    <li>No possibility to define offset and scale factor for raw data. We have to write scaled data.</li>
    <li>Multi image(page) GeoTiff files seem to be not supported by the most common GIS applications.
        Also if NewSubFileType or SubFileType is specified as PAGE and PageNumber does have no effect, too.
        Except for the above mentioned image pyramid.
    </li>
    <li>Reading an Tiff file (written by BEAM) with one image and multiple bands (~17 or just more than one)
        results in an Exception: Planar (band-sequential) format TIFF is not supported.<br/>
        PlanarConfiguration: Planar is not supported. <br/>
        Taken from the ReadMe file: <br/>
         <pre>
     TIFF file handling:
        TIFF support has the following limitations:
          * The TIFF encoder does not support LZW compression due to the patent on the algorithm.
          * Planar format (PlanarConfiguration field has value 2) is not supported for decoding or encoding.
        </pre>
        If RGB is written by JAI PlanarConfiguration = CHUNKY is used.
    </li>
    <li>GeoTIFFMetadata</li>
    Contains convinience methods <code><b>createRootTree</b></code> that will be better placed in a
    separate Utility class for TIFF-IIO?
    <li>ProductUtils</li>
    The interface was extended with <code><b>createGeoTIFFMetadata(GeoCoding, int, int)</b></code>

</ul>


<h1>Tools</h1>
<ul>
    <li>ER Viewer by Leica GeoSystems (same as Erdas Imagine)</li>
    <pre>Notes on ER Viewer TIFF support
    ER Viewer supports most common TIFF and extended GeoTIFF variants with both Mac and Intel byte orders.

    The following variants have been tested:

    24 bit RGB
    24 bit CMYK
    8 bit color mapped
    8 bit 1 band greyscale
    16 bit 1 band greyscale
    4 bit color mapped (ala Landinfo)
    1, 8 and 16 bit tiled TIFFs
    32 bit, IEEE4 and IEEE8 TIFFs
    TIFFs up to 4GB in size
    Save Support:
    The maximum size of a saved Tiff file is 4GB.</pre>
