To obtain the original version of these files and
their associated libraries, see www.geotiff.org.

1. TestXTIFF

  The TestXTIFF class tests the xtiff-jai package, and
  requires xtiff-jai.jar be in your CLASSPATH, with a
  1.2 version of the JVM and JAI 1.02 installed. When passed
  any of the ".tif" files in this directory it should load
  and display them, and create a new tiff file from the original,
  stored in TIFF 6.0 tiled format.


2. TestGeoTIFF

  The TestGeoTIFF class tests the geotiff-jai package, and
  requires both xtiff-jai.jar and geotiff-jai.jar, with a
  1.2 version of the JVM and JAI 1.02 installed. When passed
  "geo.tif" file (or other GeoTIFF files) it should load
  and display them, and create a new tiff file from the original,
  stored in TIFF 6.0 tiled format, preserving all the GeoKeys.
