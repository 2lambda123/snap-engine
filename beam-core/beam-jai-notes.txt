TODOs
=====
Image export must use JAI "filestore" operator, ImageIO cannot be used anymore!!!
NoDataOverlay --> 1-band, PlanarImage (same as for as ROI)
Don't display the tile regions which are out of image bounds

Questions
=========
Q: How are planar images released from cache?
A: TileCache.releaseTiles(RenederedImage im);
Q: How can we attach a JAI tile cache metric to a tile?
A: Override OpImage.getTileCacheMetric(), use TileCache.setComparator(...)
Q: If a setting changes, has the DAG to be recomputed? What about the images not used anymore?
A:
Q: Can we defer the compution of tiles for the display, e.g. using PlanarImage.queueTiles() and a TileComputationListener ?
A:
Q: Can't we use the JAI OpImage directly as base class for our operators?
A:

Problems
========
Unforunately all tiles are requested if
(1) navigation image is created
(2) histogram of an image is created

Ideas
=====
Bitmask overlays could be separate layers
Suggest using only WeakReferences to Product(Nodes) in JAI chains
RGB generation can be greatly optimized if all 3(4) expressions are evaluated in the same namespace
