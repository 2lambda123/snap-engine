<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
    Basically, the Pixel Extraction Tool allows to extract the pixel values given by a user-specified list of
    geographic coordinates from a given list of data products. However, a number of additional parameters may be passed
    to the tool, for example the size of the area around the geographic coordinate which is to be considered.
</p>

<h3>The Output Format</h3>

<p>
    The output format looks like this: pixelvaluebla.
</p>

<h3>The User Interface</h3>

<p>
    The user interface of the Pixel Extraction Tool mainly consists of the Input/Output-pane and the
    Parameters-pane, as well as three buttons to start the extraction process, close the
    dialog, and open this help.
</p>

<h4>The Input/Output Pane</h4>

<p>
    The Input/Output Pane allows to specify the input products and the output mode.
</p>

</p>

<p>
    The list of input paths contains data products already chosen for extraction as well as paths to be searched for
    data products. By default, the product selected in VISAT (if there is any) appears in the list. Using the
    <img src="../images/plus.png" alt="plusbutton">-Button, data products can be added to the list in multiple ways: by
    choosing a product already opened in VISAT, by choosing a product from the file system, or by specifying a
    directory on the file system which is to be searched for data products (optionally recursively).
</p>

<p>
    The radio button below the list containing the input paths allows to specify the output mode: the extracted pixel
    values may either be saved in a directory (which may be specified using the box below) or be copied to the
    clipboard, allowing the user to paste them into another tool, typically a spreadsheet program.
</p>

<p>
    The output formats slightly differ: when saving extracted pixel values to disk, a file for each product type is
    created, plus an additional file storing a mapping from product ids used in the output tables to data products.
    When, however, using the clipboard, all values are copied at once.
</p>

<h4>The Parameters Pane</h4>

<p>
    The Parameters Pane allows to specify several parameters used for the extraction.
</p>

    <img src="../images/parametersform.png" alt="parametersform"/><br/>
    <font size="2">Screenshot 2 - The Parameters Pane</font>
</p>

<p>
    The coordinates table shows the user-specified geographic coordinates which are used to extract the values. They
    consist of a name and their latitude/longitude-values. Initially, the table is filled with the pins of the product
    currently selected in VISAT; additional coordinates may be added either by newly creating them or by reading them
    from an exported pin file.
</p>

<p>
    The considered export sources may be delimited using three checkboxes, one each for bands, tie-point grids, and
    masks.
</p>

<p>
    The window size specifies the number of pixels surrounding the pixels derived from the given geographic coordinates
    to be exported. That is, when setting the window size to 3, the values for 9 pixels will be extracted. The window
    size always is odd.
</p>

<p>
    A band maths expression can be specified to filter the values to output. The "Edit Expression..."-button opens
    the expression editor, which can be used for easily editing an expression. It is only available if the
    input product list of the "Input/Output"-pane contains at least one data product; however, in any case an expression
    may manually be declared.<br>
    There are two options of how to use the expression: either the expression is used to filter the values to output,
    that is, values which do not satisfy the expression are ignored. In the other case, the information if the value met
    the expression is added to the output.
