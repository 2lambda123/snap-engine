<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
    Basically, the Pixel Extraction Tool allows to extract the pixel values given by a user-specified list of
    geographic coordinates from a given list of data products. However, a number of additional parameters may be passed
    to the tool, for example the size of the area around the geographic coordinate which is to be considered.
</p>

<h4>The Input/Output Pane</h4>

<p>
    The Input/Output Pane allows to specify the input products and the output mode.
</p>

</p>

<p>
    The list of input paths contains data products already chosen for extraction as well as paths to be searched for
    data products. By default, the product selected in VISAT (if there is any) appears in the list. Using the
    <img src="../images/plus.png" alt="plusbutton">-Button, data products can be added to the list in multiple ways: by
    choosing a product already opened in VISAT, by choosing a product from the file system, or by specifying a
    directory on the file system which is to be searched for data products (optionally recursively).
</p>

<h4>The Output Modes</h4>

<p>
    The radio button below the list containing the input paths allows to specify the output mode: the extracted pixel
    values may either be saved in a directory (which may be specified using the box below) or be copied to the
    clipboard, allowing the user to paste them into another tool, typically a spreadsheet program.
</p>

<p>
    The output formats slightly differ: when saving extracted pixel values to disk, a file for each product type is
    created, plus an additional file storing a mapping from product ids used in the output tables to data products.
    When, however, using the clipboard, all values are copied at once.
</p>

<h4>The Control Buttons</h4>

<p>
    The "Extract"-button starts the extraction process, the "Close"-button discards the specified values and closes the
    dialog. Lastly, the "Help"-button opens this help.
