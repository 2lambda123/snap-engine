<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
    The spectral unmixing tool is used to decompose a source spectrum into a set of given <i>endmembers</i>.
    The result of the unmixing is a measure of the membership of each endmember to the source source spectrum.
    This measure is called the endmember's <i>abundance</i>. The tool can also compute an error measure
    for each spectral source band and a summary, root mean square error band.
</p>


<h3>Algorithm</h3>

<p>
    The unmixing algorithms are based on the following linear mixing model, which assumes that a spectrum is a linear
    superposition of endmembers:

<p>
    The abundances can be computed using three different algorithms:
<ol>
    <li>Unconstrained LSU -
        The abundances are unconstrained and can become any numeric value.
    </li>
    <li>Constrained LSU -
        The sum of abundances equals 1. This is the default unmixing algorithm.
    </li>
    <li>Fully Constrained LSU -
        The sum of abundances equals 1 and abundance values cannot be less than zero.
    </li>
</ol>

<h4>User Interface</h4>

<p>The spectral unmixing tool can be invoked from VISAT's tool menu by selecting <b>Unmix</b>
    or in batch mode by using the command line tool <b>gpt</b> (Graph Processing Tool) and the operator
    <b>Unmix</b>. The graphical user interface provided in VISAT appears as follows:
