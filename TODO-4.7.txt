CrsGeoCoding:
=============
Stupid name because GeoCoding *has* a CRS, it isn't one. CrsGeoCoding is the GeoTools replacement for MapGeoCoding!!

GeoCoding.getDatum():
=====================
It is still the "old" BEAM Datum and should have already been replaced by the GeoTools one.

<X>LayerType:
=============
We once decided that we wanted to introduce static factory method for each(!) layer type following the JAI-Descriptor
concept. Nothing done so far.

FeatureLayer:
=============

Several problems:
- Target-CRS called FC-CRS, which is actually a view CRS.
- Clipping done against WGS84-CRS geometry if and only if feature ceollection has not been loaded from a shapefile (?!?).
