Masks:
======
* Old bitmask overlay window: Only list "real" bitmasks. What is real?
  E.g. Flag-related masks, masks set my reader, masks initially in the product,...
  It is only used for bitmask overlay, no mask management.


VectorDataNode:
===============
* Need action to create new VectorDataNode. (DONE)
* Need action to delete old VectorDataNode. (DONE, partly, see TODOs in code)
* Still need to transfer model-CRS into feature types.
  What about the image-CRS in Property DataStore? What is the EPSG code?!?!
* When reprojecting (subsetting?) products, we must also transform geometry and align CRS of feature collections in
  vector data nodes!!! Pins/GCPs need special treatment!
* Import shapefile vector data node (export shapefile is BEAM 4.8)
* What is the presentation name for VectorDataNode? E.g.
  "Vector data", "Vector data container", "Shapes", "Geometry", ...

Figures:
========
* Make pin/GCP use a GeoTools feature --> and then a figure
* Polygon bug: JTS wants 0 or 3 points.
* Still can't rotate figures
* Still no repaint while drawing new figures
* Still can not add/remove geometry vertices
* Move-Handle bug: many handles are created while dragging
* Layer style editor doesn't work anymore
* New edit menu:
  - Test Cut/Copy/Paste!
  - What about Undo/Redo?!? (should work!)
* Allow for geometric operations add/sub/intersection
* Before using an insert line/polygon interaction, we need a target layer for the figures to be inserted:
  1. If layer is selected AND layer is a vector layer --> ok
  2. If vector data node is selected:
      2.a If corresp. layer exists, select it --> ok
      2.b otherwise create corresp. layer, goto 2.a
  3. If vector data mask is selected:
      3.a Get corresponding vector data node
      3.b Goto 2 using this vector data node 

CrsGeoCoding:
=============
Stupid name because GeoCoding *has* a CRS, it isn't one. CrsGeoCoding is the GeoTools replacement for MapGeoCoding!!

GeoCoding.getDatum():
=====================
It is still the "old" BEAM Datum and should have already been replaced by the GeoTools one.

<X>LayerType:
=============
We once decided that we wanted to introduce static factory method for each(!) layer type following the JAI-Descriptor
concept. Nothing done so far.

Rectangle RasterDataNode.areaOfInterest:
========================================
We need this new property for boosting statitics computation and possibly also display.
This property is optional but some product readers may set it, e.g. SMOS reader.
Tile bounds can easily be tesated for intersection with areaOfInterest and possibly ignored. 

FeatureLayer:
=============

Several problems:
- Target-CRS called FC-CRS, which is actually a view CRS.
- Clipping done against WGS84-CRS geometry if and only if feature ceollection has not been loaded from a shapefile (?!?).

Mask DIMAP I/O
==============
- Product.masks
- RasterDataNode.imageInfo.maskReferenceList



h2. API changes:

h3. Product Data Model Changes
* Introduced Mask class
* Introduced VectorDataNode class
* Product class
** Added new methods to Product class
**# ProductNodeGroup<VectorData> getVectorDataGroup()
**# ProductNodeGroup<Mask> getMaskGroup()
** Deprecated a lot of old methods deling with {{BitRaster}} and bitmasks in general
** Change events for the following "properties" are not fired anymore: modified, owner 
* Added new methods to ProductVisitor interface:
*# void visit(Mask mask)
*# void visit(VectorDataNode dataNode)
* ProductNode class
** Rename updateExpression(s1, s2) to handleRename(node, s1, s2)  (TODO!)

h3. Ceres Binding API Changes

* Terminology changes followed by extensive renamings:
** ValueModel --> Property
** ValueDescriptor --> PropertyDescriptor
** ValueContainer --> PropertyContainer
** ValueAccessor --> PropertyAccessor
** ClassFieldDescriptorFactory --> PropertyDescriptorFactory
** ValueDescriptor.properties --> PropertyDescriptor.attributes (incl. all accessors)
* New interface PropertyAccessorFactory
* PropertyContainer.setValue(String propertyName, Object value) now throws IllegalArgumentException
 by wrapping a previously thrown ValidationException.

* PropertySet is an interface which has been extracted from PropertyContainer.
  Thus, in many places (including public BEAM API) the use of PropertyContainer has been replaced by PropertySet

* ValueEditor --> PropertyEditor
* ValueEditorRegistry --> PropertyEditorRegistry
* ValueEditorsPane --> PropertyPane


h3. Ceres Layer API Changes

* Renamed method LayerType.getConfigurationTemplate() to  createLayerConfig()
* Moved methods LayerType.createDefaultValueModel() ValueModel.createValueModel()

h3. Ceres Core API Changes
* Renamed class ServiceRegistryFactory to ServiceRegistryManager
