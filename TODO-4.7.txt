Reprojection:
=============
* Old org.esa.beam.framework.dataop.maptransf still heavily in use!
  Remove usage, deprecate and/or remove classes. Prefer deprecation.
  ==> FINAL, MZ, CLOSED (deprecated)
  
Masks:
======
* We need a special mask type masking out no-data pixels. If no-data value
  is set, it shall be used in its raw form by the mask image (OpImage).
  If valid-expression is set, it shall be AND-ed with the no-data mask,
  if any.
  ==> FINAL (v4.8), ?, OPEN
* We need a special mask type backed by a raster data buffer. Users shall
  be able to "paint" mask pixels (SYKE!). Also the "magic-stick" tool will #
  operate on such mask types. The raster data of the new mask type will need to
  be stored to disk.
  ==> FINAL (v4.8), ?, OPEN

Figures:
========
* Still can not add/remove geometry vertices
  ==> FINAL, NF, OPEN

* Still can't rotate figures.
  ==> FINAL (v4.8), NF, OPEN
* Number of created vertex handles should be dependent on current viewport
  ==> FINAL (v4.8), NF, OPEN
* Still cannot draw true circles/squares and also adjust lines and points on grid.
  ==> FINAL (v4.8), ?, OPEN
* New edit menu:
  - Test Cut/Copy/Paste!
  - What about Undo/Redo?!? (should work!)
  - After Paste: select inserted figures and displace a few (view) pixels
  ==> FINAL (v4.8), ?, OPEN
* Allow for geometric operations on geometries: add/sub/intersection (JTS!)
  ==> FINAL (v4.8), ?, OPEN


GPF Processors:
===============
* Clean up GPF packages:
  - split into beam-gpf and beam-gpf-meris
  - move N1Patcher to ICOL
  - move common MERIS stuff from ICOL & Co. into beam-gpf-meris
  ==> FINAL, ?, OPEN

* Need file and help menu items as in "old" processors
  ==> FINAL (v4.8), ?, OPEN
* Need minimal developer guide  
  ==> FINAL (v4.8), ?, OPEN
* Important issues with the band's source image:
  - dispose() method on MultiLevelImage shall not null its product node,
    use WeakReference instead.
  - Don't dispose source MultiLevelImage, if the RasterDataNode is not the
    owner, e.g. flag RasterDataNode.isSourceImageOwner()
  ==> FINAL (v4.8), ?, OPEN

SMOS-Box:
=========
* Export GridCellExporter still uses "product.getPinGroup().getSelectedNodes()" and ROIDefinition.
  ==> FINAL, *, OPEN
  
CHRIS-GeoCorrection
===================
* Auto-Download Telemetry
  ==> FINAL, RQ, OPEN
* NullPointerException after map-projection if not saved to file
  ==> FINAL, RQ, OPEN

Envisat Reprocessing 3:
=======================
* Format update
  Note: [BEAM-1070]
  ==> FINAL (v4.7.x), *, OPEN

Other BEAM/VISAT/API Stuff:
===========================

* ProductIO: update Tutorial
** ProductIO.readProduct(..., PruductSubsetDef def) remove SubsetDef
** Product.setWriter(Writer)
** Product.writeHeader()
  ==> FINAL (after public release), MZ, OPEN  

* Auto-insert BlueMarble (if WSG-84 lat/lon) and Country shapes
  ==> FINAL (really?), *, OPEN
* Avoid adding too much node listeners to a product:
  - abstract ProductNode.handleRename(node, oldName, newName)
  - abstract ProductNode.handleNodeDataChanged(node, oldName, newName)
  ==> FINAL (really?), *, OPEN

API Changes
===========

* ProductNode:  Change updateExpression(s1, s2) to handleRename(node, s1, s2)
  ==> FINAL (v4.8), ?, OPEN
