Reprojection:
=============

* Old org.esa.beam.framework.dataop.maptransf still heavily in use!
  Remove usage, deprecate and/or remove classes.
  ==> FINAL, ?, OPEN

Masks:
======

* Mask manager shall test for dependencies before deleting
  ==> FINAL, ?, OPEN
* Export mask pixels does not treat invalid data correctly (no regression!)
  ==> FINAL, ?, OPEN


* We need a special mask type masking out no-data pixels. If no-data value
  is set, it shall be used in its raw form by the mask image (OpImage).
  If valid-expression is set, it shall be AND-ed with the no-data mask,
  if any.
  ==> FINAL (v4.8), ?, OPEN
* We need a special mask type backed by a raster data buffer. Users shall
  be able to "paint" mask pixels (SYKE!). Also the "magic-stick" tool will #
  operate on such mask types. The raster data of the new mask type will need to
  be stored to disk.
  ==> FINAL (v4.8), ?, OPEN
* (OF) ROI selection will be lost by save in dim, peproj. Is it OK?

VectorDataNode:
===============
* Create subset from Product with Pins, GCPs -> GCPs outside of subset bounds are preserved, pins are not
  Explain in help, that this is intended.
  ==> FINAL, ?, OPEN
* Vector data node I/O shall encode/decode delimiter characters occurring in text converted from objects.
  ==> FINAL, ?, OPEN
* Pin & GCP Vector Data Nodes shall not be visible as long as there are no pins / GCPs
  added to the product
  ==> FINAL, ?, OPEN
* Use SLD from shapefile for styling figures
  ==> FINAL, MZ, OPEN (ongoing)
* Export vector data node to shapefile
  ==> FINAL, ?, OPEN (may exist: look into shapefile editor demo)
* Import of Geometry does not work when shapefile has no CRS and shapefile coordinates are not in WGS84.
  Explain in help, that this is intended. (better option would be to prompt the user to enter a CRS).
  ==> FINAL, ?, OPEN (see issue in Reprojection)
* "Profile plot" and "Coordinate List", are not updated when figure selection changes
  ==> FINAL, MP, OPEN (REOPEN by OF: when draw a figure in reproj. product)
* When reprojecting (subsetting?) products, we must also transform geometry and
  align CRS of feature collections in vector data nodes!!! Use FeatureCollectionClipper
  in ShapefileLayer code. Pins/GCPs need special treatment!
  Done (MZ), but this does not work when prod. will be saved/exported, than opened in VISAT and reproj. (OF)
  ==> FINAL, MZ, OPEN (REOPEN by OF)
* (OF) VISAT does not know about existing colour of geometries
  open product containing (e.g.) blue geometry-1
  create geometry-2
  --> it will be blue, just like the geometry-1
  create new figure on the geometry-1
   --> it will not be blue

Placemarks (PIN/GCP)
====================
* (OF) import/create/update using Manager
  -->
  Placemarks will be set wrong (outside of the product boundary)
* (OF) deadlock while opening an image view if 'Snap to selected PIN' on the 'Pixel Info' is selected
   create pin(s)
   on the 'Pixel Info' select 'Snap to selected PIN'
   open an other image again and again
   --> VISAT freezes. Any Exception will not be shot.
* Export Pin pixel writes 'No-data' instead of 'NaN'
  ==> FINAL, MZ, OPEN (ONGOING)  
  
* (OF) pixel info view disregards selected PIN:
  create some PINs
  select 'Snap to selected PIN' in 'Pixel Info'
  select one Pin, than other ...
  -->
  Pixel Info view will not be updated
    ==> FINAL, MZ, CLOSED
    
Figures:
========
* Select-tool shall auto-select layer containing a clicked figure
  ==> FINAL, NF, OPEN
* Deprecate or even completely remove ald Figure + Tool classes
  ==> FINAL, ?, OPEN
* Still can't rotate figures.
  ==> FINAL, NF, OPEN
* Number of created vertex handles should be dependent on current viewport
  ==> FINAL, NF, OPEN
* Still can not add/remove geometry vertices
  ==> FINAL, NF, OPEN
* Still cannot draw true circles/squares and also adjust lines and points on grid.
  ==> FINAL, ?, OPEN
* Layer style editor doesn't work anymore
  ==> FINAL, MP, OPEN
* New edit menu:
  - Test Cut/Copy/Paste!
  - What about Undo/Redo?!? (should work!)
  - After Paste: select inserted figures and displace a few (view) pixels
  ==> FINAL, ?, OPEN
* Allow for geometric operations on geometries: add/sub/intersection (JTS!)
  ==> FINAL, ?, OPEN

Product tree:
=============
* Don't display empty groups
  ==> FINAL, ?, OPEN

Layers:
=======
* We once decided that we wanted to introduce static factory methods for each(!) layer type
  following the JAI-Descriptor concept. Nothing done so far.
  ==> FINAL, ?, OPEN
* Deprecate and/or remove old Layer class code
  ==> FINAL, ?, OPEN
* Don't use class names e.g. in Session I/O.
  ==> FINAL, ?, OPEN


GPF Processors:
===============

* Need file and help menu items as in "old" processors
  ==> FINAL, ?, OPEN
* Need minimal developer guide  
  ==> FINAL, ?, OPEN
* Important issues with the band's source image:
  - dispose() method on MultiLevelImage shall not null its product node,
    use WeakReference instead.
  - Don't dispose source MultiLevelImage, if the RasterDataNode is not the
    owner, e.g. flag RasterDataNode.isSourceImageOwner()
  ==> FINAL, ?, OPEN
* Done, enable/harmonise geo-coding transfer in all GPF ops  (see BEAM-1047 and BEAM-1050)
  Changelog needs update.
  ==> FINAL, MP, OPEN
* Clean up GPF packages:
  - split into beam-gpf and beam-gpf-meris
  - move N1Patcher to ICOL
  - move common MERIS stuff from ICOL & Co. into beam-gpf-meris
  ==> FINAL, ?, OPEN

SMOS-Box:
=========
* Create add on installer
  ==> FINAL, RQ, OPEN
* Support missing 2 aux products
  ==> FINAL, RQ, OPEN
* Speed up statistics
  ==> FINAL, RQ, OPEN
* We need the RasterDataNode.areaOfInterest:Geometry new property for boosting
  statistics computation and possibly also display. This property is optional but
  some product readers may set it, e.g. SMOS reader. Tile bounds can easily be
  tested for intersection with areaOfInterest and possibly ignored.
  Also very important for SMOS-Box 2.0.1
  ==> FINAL, *, OPEN
* (OF) PIN selection  does not work:
   select 'Snap to selected PIN' in SMOS L1C Chart
                                    SMOS L1C Flag-Matrix
                                    SMOS L1C Table
   --> no data wil be displayed
* (OF) Warning "Illegal element 'imageToModelTransform'" by open session
  open session
  -->
  VISAT-Warning: " The following problen(s) occured:
  Illegal element 'imageToModelTransform'
  However the session will be opened
* (OF) no reader for  SM_OPER_AUX_VTEC_R

GlobToolbox
===========
* Create add on installer
  ==> FINAL, MP, OPEN

CHRIS-GeoCorrection
===================
* Auto-Download Telemetry
  ==> FINAL, RQ, OPEN
* NullPointerException after map-projection if not saved to file
  ==> FINAL, RQ, OPEN

Envisat Reprocessing 3:
=======================
* Format update
  ==> FINAL (v4.7.x), *, OPEN

Other BEAM/VISAT/API Stuff:
===========================
* Rename 'Pin' into 'Placemark'
  ==> FINAL, NF, OPEN
* Auto-insert BlueMarble (if WSG-84 lat/lon) and Country shapes
  ==> FINAL, *, OPEN
* Avoid adding too much node listeners to a product:
  - abstract ProductNode.handleRename(node, oldName, newName)
  - abstract ProductNode.handleNodeDataChanged(node, oldName, newName)
  ==> FINAL, *, OPEN
* Move PropertyPane and dependency to TableLayout into Ceres
  ==> FINAL, *, OPEN


//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// TODO put in Wiki

h2. API changes:

h3. Product Data Model Changes
* Introduced Mask class
* Introduced VectorDataNode class
* Product class
** Added new methods to Product class
**# ProductNodeGroup<VectorData> getVectorDataGroup()
**# ProductNodeGroup<Mask> getMaskGroup()
** Deprecated a lot of old methods deling with {{BitRaster}} and bitmasks in general
** Change events for the following "properties" are not fired anymore: modified, owner 
* Added new methods to ProductVisitor interface:
*# void visit(Mask mask)
*# void visit(VectorDataNode dataNode)
* ProductNode class
** Rename updateExpression(s1, s2) to handleRename(node, s1, s2)  (TODO!)

h3. Ceres Binding API Changes

* Terminology changes followed by extensive renamings:
** ValueModel --> Property
** ValueDescriptor --> PropertyDescriptor
** ValueContainer --> PropertyContainer
** ValueAccessor --> PropertyAccessor
** ClassFieldDescriptorFactory --> PropertyDescriptorFactory
** ValueDescriptor.properties --> PropertyDescriptor.attributes (incl. all accessors)
* New interface PropertyAccessorFactory
* PropertyContainer.setValue(String propertyName, Object value) now throws IllegalArgumentException
 by wrapping a previously thrown ValidationException.

* PropertySet is an interface which has been extracted from PropertyContainer.
  Thus, in many places (including public BEAM API) the use of PropertyContainer has been replaced by PropertySet

* ValueEditor --> PropertyEditor
* ValueEditorRegistry --> PropertyEditorRegistry
* ValueEditorsPane --> PropertyPane


h3. Ceres Layer API Changes

* Renamed method LayerType.getConfigurationTemplate() to  createLayerConfig()
* Moved methods LayerType.createDefaultValueModel() ValueModel.createValueModel()

h3. Ceres Core API Changes
* Renamed class ServiceRegistryFactory to ServiceRegistryManager
