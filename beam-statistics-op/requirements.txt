Requirements for statistics operator

- input set of data products
- input a shapefile, which contains one ore more polygons determining regions
- input temporal bounds
- input temporal steps (every month, every week, every second months)
- input statistical configuration (*)
- input band names to consider
- input valid pixel expression
- input output configuration

- output ASCII file containing statistics, grouped by regions
- output product containing bands for each statistic (num_obs, num_passes, p50)


(*)
- xth percentile
- median (as shortcut to 50th percentile)
- mean/sigma
- min/max

Important: this operator shall serve as basis for a weighted P90 operator, so make sure that computation of statistics
is highly configurable, such that the operator will easily be extendible.
